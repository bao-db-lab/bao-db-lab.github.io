## Welcome to the pages of my research projects

### Project1: Trajectory Analytics
[**T4 - Trajectories for Traffic, Transport, and Trips**](https://t4research.github.io/) is a powerful platform for analyzing different types of trajectory data, which can be applied to various applications such as Real-time Traffic Monitoring, Intelligent Traffic Signal Control and Interactive Trip Planing.

**Real-time Traffic Monitoring**
T4 enables intelligent analytics over real-time and historical trajectories from vehicles. At the front end, we visualize the current traffic flow and result trajectories of different types of queries. At the back end, T4 is able to support multiple types of common queries over trajectories, with compact storage, efficient index and pruning algorithms.

**Intelligent Traffic Signal Control**
T4 applies reinforcement learning-based traffic light controller for reducing traffic jams. We train the deep models for traffic flow prediction and traffic signal control to reduce traffic congestion.

**Interactive Trip Planing**
T4 enables users’ interactive exploration of POIs and trajectories in their incremental trip planning. At the back end, TISP is able to support seven types of common queries over spatial-only, spatial-textual and textual-only data, based on our proposed unified indexing and search paradigm. At the front end, we propose novel visualization designs to present the result of different types of queries.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/bao-db-lab/bao-db-lab.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
